# Development
- [ ] Understand what restdb is
- [ ] Understand how to use swagger.json file
Are these used to connect to the endpoint given in the email?

- [ ] Mockup a UI based on the screen shots using ReactJS

How will I bundle this up?
After understanding restdb and swagger, will I be able to use babel/webpack?
It seems like those tool will replace babel and webopack.

- [ ] Create seeding script for restdb
- [ ] frontend UI should also be paginated; 20 entries per page
- [ ] Filter by booking type -> either click on booking type to arrange by A-Z OR filter button that will gather only the filtered options.

- [ ] Unit tests -> and how?
      - API route returns X result with Y variable
      - Modal status is true when clicking on 'Create Booking'
